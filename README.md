# ClubWebsiteV2

The new Computer Science Club website, or just a website, built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Setting Up

1. First, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. If you don't, visit
   https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the current version.
2. After installing NodeJS, restart your computer.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And now you're good to go! You should be able to open the URL that appears in your console in your browser.
Don't worry about refreshing the page, SvelteKit comes with hot reloading, so any changes you make are
show instantly!
